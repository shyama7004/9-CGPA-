## Reasons I Scored 7.86 SGPA in 2nd Semester

### 1. Maths
   - **Reason:** I faked my hard work; I wasn't consistent. 
   - I thought I followed my teacher, but in reality, I didn't. I should have solved 2-3 questions daily.
   - I always made excuses and never solved assignments.

   **Note:** It might seem that I'm weak in maths, but throughout my life, I have always scored well in maths. That's why I thought college maths would be the same as school maths.

   **SGPA Growth:** 8.28

### 2. Mechanics
   - I thought I followed my teacher, but I didn't. I should have solved 3-4 questions daily and followed my notes rather than relying on YouTube.
   - I missed some important classes.

   **SGPA Growth:** 8.56

### 3. Electronics
   - I understood every point the teacher made, even though nobody else did. I went      along with what others said.
   - I should have focused on the teacher's notes and past year questions (PYQs).

   **SGPA Growth:** 8.702

### 4. AutoCAD
   - Interaction was zero.
   - Instead of doing the project on my own, I relied on others and didn't make any notes, thinking it was just a lab.

   **SGPA Growth:** 8.90

### 5. English
   - I completely ignored it and didn't make notes.

   **SGPA Growth:** 8.895

### 6. EVS
   - I completely neglected it during the end-semester exams.
   - I didn't touch it; revision was out of scope.
   - No PYQs, no notes, nothing.

   **SGPA Growth:** 9.321

## What Did I Learn?
1. **Don't waste time on friends:** They won't help improve my SGPA.
2. **Trust your notes:** For college, notes are sufficient.
3. **Solve relevant questions:** Focus on questions similar to PYQs and class questions.
4. **Trust your teacher and interact with them:** It's crucial to get noticed.
5. **Solve PYQs and revise daily:** Revision is the key to perfection.
